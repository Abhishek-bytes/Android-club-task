# Android-club-task

Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Android Club recruitment task. It consists of two main components:

Task 1: Customer Churn Prediction for a Subscription-Based Business (answered in a PDF file included in the repository).
Task 2: Customer Segmentation for a Marketing Campaign using Machine Learning.
The main objective of this project is to analyze customer data, develop predictive models, and propose actionable strategies for marketing and customer retention.

Files in Repository
customer_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, clustering, and analysis for Task 2.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies used in the project.
app.py: Streamlit app script for an interactive dashboard (optional, bonus task for Task 2).
marketing_campaign.csv: Dataset file used for the analysis (if permissible to upload).
Task_1_Answers.pdf: PDF file answering all questions from Task 1.
README.md: This file describing the project.
Steps to Run the Project
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the customer_segmentation.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess data, perform clustering, and interpret the results.
3. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard (Optional)
To view the interactive dashboard for Task 2:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Project Highlights
Task 1: Customer Churn Prediction
This task focuses on predicting which customers are likely to churn from a subscription-based business. The PDF file Task_1_Answers.pdf contains:

Strategies to handle imbalanced data.
Insights into important features affecting churn.
Methods to explain predictions to non-technical stakeholders.
Steps for deploying a machine learning model in production.
Task 2: Customer Segmentation
Preprocessed and analyzed customer data to group them into meaningful clusters.
Used the KMeans clustering algorithm.
Visualized high-dimensional data using PCA for better interpretability.
Developed marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
